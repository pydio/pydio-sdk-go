For more information, please visit [https://pydio.com](https://pydio.com)

## Installation

Put the package under your project folder and add the following in import:

```go
    "github.com/pydio/pydio-sdk-go"
```

## Update SDK

_This is for the maintainers of pydio-sdk-go project only._

To update the Cells go sdk, you must folloy the steps below:

_First time only_:

```sh
# go to the roots of this directory, typically:
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pydio/pydio-sdk-go
# Retrieve swagger binary if necessary
## for linux
wget https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/0.14.0/swagger_linux_amd64 
## for Mac OS
wget https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/0.14.0/swagger_darwin_amd64
```

_After each API Spec modification_:

```sh
# retrieve latest spec file from pydio-core project
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydio/pydio-core/develop/core/src/plugins/core.ajaxplorer/routes/api2.json
# Delete folder models and client 
# Generate updated code
./swagger generate client --skip-validation -f api2.json

# Apply the twick to workaround int64 serialisation issue between protobuf and swagger
go run main.go twick-model
```

You should also update version information at the top of this page.

**NOTE**: we use the --skip-validation flag to avoid circular issues
